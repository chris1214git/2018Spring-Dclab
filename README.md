# 2018Spring-Dclab

The final project - Draw Your Life, received First place in NTU DCLab 2018 Spring. 

Draw your life is a light and voice controllable painter implemented in FPGA. Control VGA, SSD, camera, microphone module by various protocols. With a self-made laser-pointer and a camera, we could draw different shapes or colors in the air. To overcome the glitch of laser light, we implemented different algorithms to pad and filter the noises. There is also memory optimization in saving the drawings. Finally, by aggregating the FFT processor, our painter is able to change the setting by our voice pitch.
